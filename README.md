    Uber
        - Live interractive map feeature 
        - Multiple views and screens 
    
    
    I would like to build an app that lets users find interresting activities happening in their city. It can be any activity such as bike ride, going to a musuem, bar, art show.
    Strangers can meet and become friends and enjoy different activities. A nice feature to implement is a profile of users that you can interract with and stage page that is showing what
    is happening now. 
    

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Add challenges creating the giff using Kap, had to use another software called record it to generate a giff of the Pre-work app and uploading to GitHub.
